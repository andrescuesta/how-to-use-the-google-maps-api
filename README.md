## Instructor: [Reginald Dawson][instructor url]


Google has made its powerful web services—like Drive, Maps, and Gmail—available to users worldwide for free. Not only that, but Google has opened the power of these services up to developers with full-featured APIs. The Google Maps API allows you to leverage Google's huge library of street and satellite maps for your own apps.

In this course, Reggie Dawson will teach you how the Google Maps API works and how you can use it in your projects. By the end, you'll know how to create and embed maps in your web app. You'll see how to customize every part of the map's appearance, and how to use features like direction finding and Street View.
